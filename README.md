# HW9 - README generator
  
  ## Description
The challenge we chose to accept is to build an app that  that uses the command line to take inputs about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. 
Because testing is key to making code maintainable, youâ€™ll also write unit tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes all of them.
